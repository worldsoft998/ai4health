We redefined our scope of business

Initially this site is planned to offer information about AI in healthcare application progress focusing on cancer diagnosis and treatment. Along with time we have added other types of non-cancer diseases such as stroke, and now we are more or less shifting to help people keep healthy by monitoring their health status with AI's aid, *** before they are getting sick ***. Be aware, we emphasize the word "before", because it is more important to keep you healthy than to make you treated after you got stricken by a sickness. Therefore our focus now is more or less on reporting on progress on AI's technologies and products which can help you individuals to get first-hand assistance to let you know how healthy you're are, how risky you're at being sick in one way or other if you keep your current life style, and how the AI assisted monitoring and advisory tools can help you avoid possible diseases before they are serious to your health.
