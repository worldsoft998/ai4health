# AI-Model-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
This project is an implementation of a neural network model to diagnose cancer based on several features. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is named cancer.csv and contains data on cancer patients. It has 569 rows and 32 columns, including an ID column and a diagnosis column indicating whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The other columns include several features of the tumors, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more.
